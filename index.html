                This graph compares the average income in dollars, to the number of respondants who claim to have been unable to visit a doctor for financial reasons, even though they felt they needed to. When using excel to determine the degree of correlation a value of 0.47 was returned, meaning that the data is slightly correlated, but not as heavily as expected. It was hypothesized that there would be strong, direct correlation between the two variables. This Graph only looks at two variables and creates a "tooltip" when moused over, this tool tip displays specific data related to the state. Each state has unique values and can be examined.
